# FindMind

## Introduction

Welcome to my submission project for FindMind Analytics in which I made a nice little task management system in React/Redux and using Axios.

## Launching

There's a pretty standard procedure for checking out the end result. Simply:

1. Clone this repository on your local system
2. `cd` into the find-mind directory using the command `cd find-mind` in the command line
3. Use `yarn start` (or `npm start`) and wait a few seconds and the project should open up in `localhost:3000`

If you followed the above steps correctly you should be good to go and a sign-in page should show up.

## Navigation

### Sign In page

For the current version, no sign-in authentication has been set up and the page is displayed solely for design purposes. In order to proceed to the dashboard, simply press either of the `Log In` or the `Sign Up` buttons

### Dashboard

This is the main page of the project. The simple task-management system consists of a number of "lists" (sample "My Tasks" shown).

You can add a new task in any list by pressing the `+ Add task` button. You will be prompted to enter the Title and Description of the new task and once you enter those, the new task should appear in the list.

You can add a new list in the dashboard by pressing the `+` button in the bottom right corner. You will be prompted to enter the name of the list and the new list would appear on the dashboard.

You can redirect

This concludes the features that this version of the project has.
